IoT (Internet of Things) systems refer to a network of interconnected physical devices or objects, such as sensors, appliances, vehicles, and other electronics, that are capable of exchanging data and communicating with each other over the internet. These systems typically consist of four main components: sensors or devices that collect data, a network that facilitates data transmission

An embedded system is a computer system that is designed to perform specific functions and is integrated into a larger device or system. Unlike general-purpose computers, embedded systems are dedicated to executing a narrow range of tasks and are optimized for specific applications. Examples of embedded systems include those found in automobiles, medical equipment, industrial machinery, and consumer electronics.

A sensor is a device that detects and responds to physical stimuli, such as light, heat, sound, or motion, and converts it into an electrical signal. Sensors are used in a wide range of applications, from environmental monitoring to industrial control systems and consumer electronics. There are many different types of sensors, including temperature sensors, pressure sensors, proximity sensors, motion sensors, and optical sensors. 

An actuator is a mechanical or electrical device that is used to control or move a system or mechanism. Actuators typically convert electrical energy, hydraulic pressure, or pneumatic pressure into mechanical motion, and are used in a wide variety of applications, from robotics and automation to aerospace and automotive systems

In IoT, the environment refers to the physical surroundings in which IoT devices and systems are deployed and operate

An MCU (Microcontroller Unit) board is a printed circuit board (PCB) that contains a microcontroller, which is a small computer on a single chip that integrates the processor, memory, and input/output peripherals.

In IoT, an alarm is a notification or alert that is triggered by a sensor or device when a certain condition or event occurs. Alarms are often used in monitoring and control systems to notify users of abnormal conditions, such as changes in temperature, humidity, pressure, or motion.

Interface pins are connectors or terminals on a device or system that enable it to communicate with other devices or systems. Interface pins typically provide electrical signals or data transfer protocols that allow devices to exchange information or signals. Examples of interface pins include USB ports, HDMI ports, Ethernet jacks, and GPIO (General Purpose Input/Output) pins on a microcontroller.

The pinMode() function sets the specified pin to either INPUT, OUTPUT, or INPUT_PULLUP mode, depending on the intended use of the pin.
 
 The digitalRead() function takes a pin number as input, and returns a value indicating whether the pin is HIGH or LOW.
 
 libraries: MQTT: a lightweight messaging protocol for IoT that is widely used for communication between IoT devices and servers.
 wifi,bluetooth,http 
 Time: Time libraries are used to track time and schedule tasks in IoT applications. IoT devices often need to perform tasks at specific intervals, such as reading sensor data every minute or sending data to a server every hour.
 
 The sleep function is a programming function used in IoT applications to temporarily suspend or halt the execution of a program for a specified period of time, typically in order to save power or resources.
 
 UART (Universal Asynchronous Receiver/Transmitter) is a hardware communication protocol that allows two devices to communicate with each other over a serial interface. UART is commonly used in IoT applications for communication between microcontroller
 
 In IoT, MCB stands for "Microcontroller Board," which is a small computer system designed to control various hardware devices and sensors in an IoT project.


RFID (Radio Frequency Identification) is a wireless technology used in IoT applications to identify and track objects or people using radio waves.

DLC (Data Link Control) Home Gateway is a device used in IoT applications to connect multiple devices and sensors in a home or office environment to the internet.

Jumper cables can also be used in other applications where a temporary electrical connection is needed between two points. 

A resistor is an electronic component that limits or controls the flow of electrical current in a circuit. A resistor works by providing resistance to the flow of current, which is measured in ohms (Î©).

A capacitor is an electronic component that stores electrical energy in an electric field. It consists of two conductive plates separated by an insulating material known as a dielectric.
